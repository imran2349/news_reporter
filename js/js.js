        description: "KARACHI: Following the final days play in National Stadium Karachi between Pakistan and New Zealand, several Pakistani cricketers met New Zealands master batter Kane Williamson and sought tips from him. As soon as the match and post-match presentation concluded, Pakistani cricketers Salman Ali Agha, Saud Shakeel, Abdullah Shafiq, and Shan Masood gathered around Kane Williamson and started discussing various aspects of batting with the top Kiwi batter. The players could be heard talking about batting longer in five-day cricket, footwork, and other aspects of batting. At one point, when Saud asked Williamson about his techniques, the Kiwi cricketer said “it is not easy to bowl you out,” before telling Pakistani batters about the areas where he can work further. Williamson advised Pakistani batters to be patient and remain focused on the game. He also spoke about foot movement in different conditions and shared his experience of playing on different wickets in different countries. Seeing batters talking to Williamson, Pakistans batting coach Mohammad Yousuf also joined the gathering and started discussing various aspects with the New Zealand batter. Earlier, Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Sarfaraz Ahmeds counter-attacking hundred foiled New Zealands bid for a series-clinching victory as the second Test between the sides ended in a dramatic draw after an action-packed final day on Friday."

Another fantastic inning by Sarfaraz bhai. Keep shining, The skipper wrote on Twitter as the wicket-keeper-batter helped Pakistan draw the match with his magnificent ton. This was the right-handers first hundred since 2014 and fourth overall. Ahmed was also named player of the match and series after scoring 335 runs in four innings, with the help of three fifties and a hundred. During the post-match presentation ceremony, Ahmed said: I was part of the team for four years and despite not getting chances here I was continuing to play well elsewhere. Wanted an opportunity from Allah Almighty and got it. I was very tense in the first Test, but the boys and captain gave me confidence. [Last session today] when 140 runs were left, the management said that you need to keep trying to score when the ball is there to hit. But then two wickets fell, and so we changed our style of play. If those two wickets didnt fall then the result couldve been something else, the right-hander said."

        description: "KARACHI: Pakistans last pair Naseem Shah and Abrar Ahmed survived 21 balls in fading light Friday while Sarfaraz Ahmed hit a fighting century to deprive New Zealand of a victory, bringing the second Test to a sensational draw in Karachi. New Zealand were in sight of a series-clinching victory after dismissing Sarfaraz for a career-best 118 with 39 balls remaining in the match. But as dusk settled, Naseem scored 15 and Ahmed seven to guide Pakistan to 304-9 in pursuit of a 319-run target when umpires Alex Wharf and Aleem Dar declared the light unfeasible to continue with three overs remaining. The two-match series ended 0-0 after the first Test — also in Karachi — ended in a draw, depriving New Zealand of their first series win in Pakistan for 53 years. New Zealand took the second new ball and with the fourth delivery Tim Southee dismissed Agha Salman for 30 to break a 70-run stand for the seventh wicket before Bracewell dismissed Sarfaraz to raise hopes of a win. But it was Sarfaraz whose fourth Test century — first in eight years — which set Pakistan on course for a fighting draw. Pakistan were staring at defeat at lunch with a total of 125-5, but Sarfaraz led the fight back during a sixth-wicket stand of 123 in three hours with Saud Shakeel who made 32. Pakistan reached 179-5 at tea, needing a further 140 runs in the 31 overs — a point from where Sarfaraz sped up the run rate by smashing three boundaries and a six off spinner Michael Bracewell before driving pacer Matt Henry for two to reach his hundred."

        description: "LONDON: Unwanted by Europes elite clubs, Cristiano Ronaldos steep decline has been laid bare by a move to Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr that signals the end of his reign as one of footballs most feared strikers. Ronaldo will be officially unveiled by Al Nassr on Tuesday after agreeing to a contract that runs until 2025 and is reportedly worth more than 200 million euros. But the riches and fanfare that await the 37-year-old in Saudi Arabia are at odds with his reduced status as a fallen star trading on past heroics. For Ronaldo to be forced to play out what will surely be the final chapter of his glittering career in the football backwater of Saudi Arabia is a damning indictment of his lacklustre form over the last 18 months. Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon Or winner, heads to the Gulf after a painful year that saw him relegated to the Portugal bench and cut adrift by Manchester United. His second spell with United imploded in November with his departure by mutual consent, shortly after he criticised boss Erik ten Hag and the clubs hierarchy in an explosive television interview. As his relationship with United soured, Ronaldo was linked to a string of Champions League contenders including Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Napoli."

The decision was taken at the second meeting of the PCBs Management Committee at the National High-Performance Centre chaired by the committees chairman Najam Sethi in Lahore, a statement from the PCB said. However, the committee agreed to revive the junior series on a home-and-away basis in order to ensure that high-performing teenagers are given opportunities to grow and the country continues to produce talented cricketers across all age gaps. The committee has also decided to hold discussions with the Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchises to encourage them to include an under-19 player under their Emerging Categories in the playing line-ups. It must be noted that the inaugural season of PJL was held earlier this year, with Bahawalpur Royals beating Gwadar Sharks in the final to clinch the title. The management committee, led by Sethi, also took important decisions regarding departmental cricket in the country. The PCB Management Committee held an extensive discussion on the restoration of the Regional and District Cricket Associations and Departments/Service Organisations in line with the PCB Constitution 2014. Following detailed discussions, it was decided that regional and district cricket associations and departments/service organisations stand restored and a strategic plan will now be prepared to include them formally in the domestic cricket structure, including participation in the PCB Board of Governors in due course. Moreover, the meetings participants also approved the constitution of 12 PCB committees and agreed that their compositions would be announced in due course. "

        description: "WASHINGTON: Republican Kevin McCarthy was elected speaker of the US House of Representatives early on Saturday after making extensive concessions to a group of right-wing hardliners that raised questions about the partys ability to govern. The 57-year-old Californian suffered one final humiliation when Representative Matt Gaetz withheld his vote on the 14th ballot as midnight approached, prompting a scuffle in which fellow Republican Mike Rogers had to be physically pulled away. McCarthys victory on the 15th ballot ended the deepest congressional dysfunction in over 160 years. But it sharply illustrated the difficulties that he would face in leading a narrow and deeply polarized majority. He won at last on a margin of 216-212. He was able to be elected with the votes of fewer than half the House members only because six in his own party withheld their votes - not backing McCarthy as the leader, but also not voting for another contender. Im glad that its over. McCarthy told reporters shortly after the vote. McCarthy agreed to a demand by hardliners that any lawmaker is able to call for his removal at any time. That will sharply cut the power he will hold when trying to pass legislation on critical issues, including funding the government, addressing the nations looming debt ceiling and other crises that may arise. We got the things that are transformational, said Republican Representative Ralph Norman, who voted to back McCarthy after opposing him for much of the week. Republicans weaker-than-expected performance in Novembers midterm elections left them with a narrow 222-212 majority, which has given outsized power to the right-wing hardliners who have opposed McCarthys leadership. Those concessions, including sharp spending cuts and other curbs on McCarthys leadership, could point to further turbulence in the months ahead, especially when Congress will need to sign off on a further increase of the United States $31.4 trillion borrowing authority."

        description: "MEXICO CITY: 19 suspected gang members and 10 military personnel were killed in a wave of violence surrounding the arrest of Mexican drug cartel boss Ovidio Guzman in the northern state of Sinaloa, Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said on Friday. Mexican security forces captured Guzman, the 32-year-old son of jailed kingpin Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, in the early hours of Thursday morning, prompting hours of unrest and shootouts with gang members, the minister said. Guzman was extracted by helicopter from the house where he was caught and flown to Mexico City, before being taken to a maximum security federal prison, Sandoval added. The arrest spurred the powerful Sinaloa Cartel — once headed by El Chapo himself — to go on a rampage, setting vehicles on fire, blocking roads, and fighting security forces in and around Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa. Twenty-one other people were arrested during Thursdays operations, Sandoval told a news conference, adding there were no reports of any civilian deaths. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said there were no immediate plans to extradite Ovidio to the United States, where his father is in a maximum security prison after being extradited in 2017 and found guilty in a New York court. The elements (of the case) have to be presented and the judges in Mexico decide, the president said. It is a process...It is not just the request. No U.S forces had assisted in Ovidios capture, Lopez Obrador said. An enhanced security presence will now remain in place in Sinaloa, on Mexicos Pacific coast, to protect the public, with an additional 1,000 military personnel travelling to the region today, Sandoval said."

During a closed-door briefing to lawmakers on Thursday, the South Korean spy agency also shared its assessment of former North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho and said apparently he has been purged, The Korea Herald reported. The NIS (National Intelligence Service) believes North Korean leader Kim Jong-uns public appearance with his daughter is intended to showcase his will to pass on the regime to his children, The Daily quoted Youn Kun-young, a lawmaker, as telling reporters after the meeting. Since November, North Korean state-run media has been publishing Kims photographs accompanying his young daughter during visits to Defense Ministrys missile and weapons sites. However, Kims sister Kim Yo Jong, who is the vice department director of the Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea, is also considered by some analysts to be a possible successor. Kim took the power in the country in 2011 after the death of his father Kim Jong-II, who was the second supreme leader. Kims grandfather Kim II-sung was the first supreme leader of North Korea from 1948 to 1994. NIS also confirmed former North Korean Foreign Minister Ri was purged but did not confirm his execution, according to The Daily.

From Sunday, China will end the requirement for inbound travellers to quarantine, the latest dismantling of its zero-COVID regime that began last month following historic protests against a suffocating series of mass lockdowns. But the abrupt changes have exposed many of Chinas 1.4 billion population to the virus for the first time, triggering an infection wave that is overwhelming some hospitals, emptying pharmacy shelves of medication and causing international alarm. Greece, Germany and Sweden on Thursday joined more than a dozen countries to demand COVID tests from Chinese travellers, as the World Health Organisation said Chinas official virus data was under-reporting the true extent of its outbreak. Chinese officials and state media have struck a defiant tone, defending the handling of the outbreak, playing down the severity of the surge and denouncing foreign travel requirements for its residents. No matter how China decides to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic, some Western media and some Western politicians will never be satisfied, The Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Partys official Peoples Daily, wrote in an editorial late on Thursday. The global aviation industry, battered by years of pandemic curbs, has also been critical of the decisions to impose testing on travellers from China. China will still require pre-departure testing for inbound travellers after January 8."

The guided-missile destroyer USS Chung-Hoon conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit on Jan. 5 (local time) through waters where high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law, the Navy said in a statement. Chung-Hoons transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military flies, sails and operates anywhere international law allows. Taiwan lives under constant threat of an invasion by China, which claims the self-ruled, democratic island as part of its territory to be seized one day — by force if necessary. Washington diplomatically recognizes Beijing over Taipei, but maintains de-facto relations with Taiwan and supports the islands right to decide its own future. Tensions in the Taiwan Strait have been tense for some years and they soared to their highest level in years in August 2022 after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei amid warnings from China. Beijing staged days of air and sea exercises around the island as a strong response to the visit of the US official. Pelosi, the highest-level US visitor to Taiwan in 25 years, praised its democracy and pledged American solidarity during her brief stopover. Chinese anger could not stop world leaders from travelling there, she said. China summoned the US ambassador in Beijing in protest and halted several agricultural imports from Taiwan. "

China, which claims Taiwan as its own despite strong objections of the democratic island, has been ramping up pressure on Taiwan to assert its sovereignty claims, including almost daily Chinese air force missions near the island over the past three years. Anders Fogh Rasmussen drew a parallel between Russias invasion of Ukraine and Chinas military aggression towards Taiwan, saying democratic countries must work in unity to ensure an Ukraine victory in order to deter a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Any attempt by China to change the status quo in Taiwan by force should spark an equally unified response and we must make this clear to China now, hina is far more reliant on global supply chains than Russia. Spelling out the severe economic consequences of any attack now would be a powerful deterrent, he said, adding he believed that Chinese President Xi Jinping was watching closely how the war in Ukraine pans out. Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister who was one of the worlds most-senior diplomats until he left the transatlantic defence alliance in 2014, urged European countries to come up with comprehensive sanctions on China if it ever moves on Taiwan. China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control if necessary. Taiwan says only its people can decide their own future and that Beijings claims are void as the Peoples Republic of China has never governed the island."

Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in terror incidents, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, during the past couple of months after the proscribed TTP declared to end the ceasefire with Islamabad.

On December 27, a Twitter user claimed that the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) has taken back “its application against Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case.” The user added that this was done after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) ordered the government to make public the records of the gifts received by all prime ministers and presidents in the country. Another Twitter user wrote: “[When] the Islamabad High Court ordered to see the record of [all] Toshakhana gifts from 1947, the imported government withdrew the Toshakhana case against Imran Khan on fear of being exposed.” There are currently four cases, in four different courts, related to the Toshakhana scandal, and none have been filed by the incumbent government nor has any been withdrawn. The first case, regarding the state gift depository, was filed in September 2021 in the Islamabad High Court by then government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) against journalist Rana Abrar and the Pakistan Information Commission (PIC). The PTI wanted the PICs order, to publicise the details of gifts received by then prime minister Imran Khan between 2018 and 2021, declared illegal. Proceedings in this case are still ongoing and the next date of hearing is on February 6. The second case was filed in a district and sessions court of Islamabad in November by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) against Imran Khan. In the petition, the Commission has pleaded with the Courts to proceed against Khan for being involved in corrupt practices, for failing to disclose the gifts he bought from the Toshakhana. The next date of hearing is on January 9. A third case was filed in December in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) by a lawyer calling on the Court to direct the government to provide details of all the state gifts received by prime ministers and presidents from 1947 onwards. The next date of hearing of this case has not been fixed. A fourth case related to the Toshkhana is ongoing in the Lahore High Court (LHC) and is similar to one ongoing in the IHC.

After the news was reported in the media, multiple social media accounts wondered if the multinational company had registered under the social media rules, rolled out last year, which the Islamabad High Court had recently directed the government to revisit. It is true, Google is being registered under the 2021 social media rules. On December 9, a social media user wrote that Google will be registering “following Pakistans social media rules.” While Nighat Dad, lawyer and digital rights activist, asked in a Twitter thread on what terms had Google agreed to open local offices while the rules are still contentious and the Islamabad High Court had directed that the rules be deliberated on in the parliament. The Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Amin ul Haque confirmed to Geo Fact Check that Google Asia Pacific Ltd has registered with the SECP on November 8, under the Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight, and Safeguards) Rules enacted in 2021 by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government. “This is good news that Google has registered,” said the minister, over the phone, “We are hopeful that they will open an office in Pakistan too.” The 2021 rules require social media companies, which have more than 500,000 users, to open an office in the federal capital as well. But in May, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) referred the social media rules back to the parliament to review in order to ensure freedom of expression. The minister said that as per the courts order the ministry of law and justice has constituted a committee to take all stakeholders — national and international — on board before amending the rules. “But the court did not prevent us from registering companies under [previous rules],” Haque added. The minister further stated that Pakistani authorities are also in touch with TikTok and Facebook to open up offices in Islamabad. For many digital rights activists, one concern is that under the rules once a social media company sets up locally they will be required to provide to Pakistans investigation agencies any user information and data in “decrypted, readable and comprehensible format”. On this, the minister said that while they still have to sign an agreement with Google, they have “till now not [asked the company] for any [user] data to be shared.” "

His claim is false. Imran Sabir, who hails from the Okara district in Punjab, has alleged on several television programs that he is the first man in Pakistan since 1947, to finish a 100-metre race in less than 10.25 seconds. On September 23, at an event at the press club in Okara, held to honour Sabir, he claimed to be the number one in Pakistan in the category of the 100-metres race. “It is a record no Pakistani has broken till date,” he boasted. During an interview with a local channel on October 3, Sabir alleged that he had set the record during an event at Lahores Minhaj University in 2021. “I ran by wearing 1,200g joggers,” he told the host of the show, “I covered the distance in less than 10.25 seconds and was later given an award by President Arif Alvi and the Speaker of the National Assembly Qasim Suri.” “Imran Sabir holds no such record,” Muhammad Zafar, the honorary secretary of the Federation, said. Geo Fact Check then contacted Sabir to provide proof of his claim of being the fastest man in the country. Sabir provided certificates from the Hashmi Learning School in Lahore, dated 2016 and 2018. He did not provide any certificate from Minhaj University. The 2016 certificate states that Sabir was being awarded for “participating in the annual sports gala” and covering the 100-m race in just 11.15 seconds wearing 1,200g shoes.” While the 2018 certificate reads that Sabir covered the 100-metre distance in just 10.25 seconds. But Chaudhry Muhammad Fayyaz, the principal of the Hashmi Learning School, told Geo Fact Check that he does not recognise the certificates shared by Sabir. “A certificate of this type has never been printed by our school,” he said, “Our schools monogram has been used and this is totally fake.” The signatures on the certificates were of Adil Nawaz, who was a teacher at the school. “My signatures have been used, but these are not the certificates which I signed,” he said over the phone. This time, Sabir altered his story and said that since two of his fingers were crooked therefore he was classified as a disabled person in the 100-metre race. Sabir is also often seen wearing a coat with an insignia of the National Paralympic Committee of Pakistan, which promotes sports for the disabled in the country. "

        description: "After Parvez Elahi was elected chief minister of Punjab in July, his government issued a raft of notifications to create new divisions and districts in the province. The official notifications, some of which have made it online, have led to confusion about the exact numbers of divisions and districts as of now in Punjab. On October 31, a social media user wrote on Twitter that five new districts have been created in Punjab, namely Murree, Talagang, Wazirabad, Kot Addu and Taunsa. This he added had increased the total number of districts in the province to 41. On November 24, another Twitter account asked how many districts were there in the province, 32 or 41 or 34. There are, at the moment, 10 divisions and 40 districts in Punjab, as per the official notifications of the Punjab Board of Revenue. On October 14, the coalition government of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q) designated Gujrat as a new division in the province. This has brought the total number of divisions in the province to 10, which are: Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Multan, Sahiwal, Bahawalpur, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Dera Ghazi Khan and now Gujrat. Not only that, four districts — Wazirabad, Hafizabad, Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin — have been added to the newly-established Gujrat division. Moreover, the Board of Revenue has also notified Wazirabad, Murree, Kot Addu and Talagang as districts as well. This has increased the total number of districts in the province to 40. Punjabs Land Revenue Act of 1967 allows the provincial government to divide the province into divisions for administrative convenience. Gujrat is the hometown of Chief Minister Parvez Elahi. For the new Gujrat division, Elahs government has carved out districts from the Gujranwala division — therefore Hafizabad and Mandi Bahauddin  — and added them to the Gujrat division. This has led to outrage amongst lawmakers from these districts, who complain that this decision will create problems for residents. Shaukat Bhatti, a PTI MNA from Hafizabad, has been protesting against the inclusion of Hafizabad in the Gujrat division. “It is unfair. Hafizabad and Gujrat dont even share a boundary,” Bhatti said, in a video message posted online, “Gujranwala [division] is closer to us than Gujrat [division].” "

He bagged best Director Award at Washington DC South Asian Film Festival 2022 and he is right now preparing for two big projects. Discussing the fate of independent films, he said, “This is a good phase for independent films. Though there may be so many lobbies and production houses but good thing is films get a window to release nowadays which was not the case earlier. My film Who Am I is an independent film, with good but lesser-known actors, producer whom I met through Facebook and everyone in the crew is under 25 years. We shot it in the interiors of Madhya Pradesh. Now, we plan to release it in theatres or maybe OTT — whatever might be it fate?” In an interview with Hindustan Times, he shared that he was just 13 when he started his directorial career. He said, “It started around 2013, when mobiles had become smarter with good cameras. So, I directed my first short film Uday that reached the semi-final round at Lake City film Festival, Nigeria. It fuelled my desire and eventually I joined Subhash Ghais institute. In between, I started getting industry opportunities and became associate creative producer at a production house where I was involved in films like Habaddi, Chaman Bahaar, KD and Kanpuriye.” "

        description: "Former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja has said that despite his good performances in white-ball cricket, the national teams skipper Babar Azam is being pushed into pointless controversies. Thanks to a half-century each from skipper Babar, Mohammad Rizwan, and Fakhar Zaman, and Naseem Shah five-for, Pakistan beat New Zealand Monday by six wickets in the opening ODI. Raja heaped praise on Babar and Rizwan for their performance which helped Pakistan secure a win in the opening ODI to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam were under a lot of pressure. The pressure was created on Babars captaincy for no reason, unfortunately. This is how a teams atmospheres are spoiled, the former cricketer said on his official YouTube channel Ramiz Speaks. He is being asked tough questions and being put into pointless controversies. This team has done well recently in white-ball cricket as they have avoided controversy and been consistent with their combination. He played a very good knock under pressure. Left-handed batter Shan Masood was appointed Pakistan ODI skipper for the New Zealand series, replacing Rizwan.The former commentator also slammed the decision to remove Rizwan from ODI vice-captaincy and said: Rizwan was under a lot of pressure too. His runs were very really important. I dont understand why he was removed from vice-captaincy. How will this benefit anyone? We know he gives his best for the team. There is no bigger fighter for Pakistan. Use his energy and commitment. Such an experience shouldnt happen, especially in white-ball cricket. Hes been a regular vice-captain and has a great comfort level with Babar. For no reason, that comfort level was removed. I think its a really bad decision that puts the team under pressure. Pakistan have a chance to become the number one ODI team in the world during the series against New Zealand. If Pakistan whitewash New Zealand 3-0 during the three-match series, they will jump to the number one spot in the rankings with 114 rating points. "

Meghan Markles hubby was accompanied by a guard carrying a Glock lock box, used to carry the semi-automatic pistol and ammunition. Harry has become increasingly concerned for his security since stepping back from senior royal duties in 2020 meant he no longer benefited from round-the-clock protection. However, Harrys recent remarks about Taliban have apparently forced him to tighten his security. It comes after Princess Dianas former bodyguard Ken Wharfe advised Harry to beef up his security and warned that the  Duke could face Salman Rushdie-like attack over his claims about the killing of Taliban. Speaking to GB News Camilla Tominey, Mr Wharfe said the Dukes revelation is concerning as he branded the claims ill-judged. Dians former bodyguard said: In the last two or three days a number of leading military personnel have condemned his ill-judged actions, and I think it was incredibly foolish of him. Lets be quite frank about this. Weve already had statements from Afghanistan. And you only have to look at what happened to Salman Rushdie recently - nobody anticipated an attack like that. Harry has taken part in a series of TV interviews in the UK and the US to coincide with the launch of his book. During his appearance at Good Morning America, the Duke appeared telling host Michael Strahan that he would likely never return to live in the United Kingdom."

However, the motorcycle plant would remain operative, it added. Earlier, the automobile, as well as motorcycle plants of the company, remained shut for a period from Jan 02 — Jan 06. A spokesperson for the PSMC said last week the company was facing a critical time due to import restrictions and also no future information on how much more time the issues would continue. “Detention, demurrages, and kibor+3% are really hurting our industry,” he said. The spokesperson stated that dealerships and vendors were also disturbed by reduced sales and production. He requested the government to have a discussion with the industry to solve the matter on an urgent basis. Dependent on imports, the Pakistan auto industry has been caught in the midst of a crisis amid import restrictions by the government. Passenger car sales decreased by 39% in the first five months of the financial year 2023 to 55,144 units, against 90,303 units sold in the same period last year, according to Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA).

A number of companies have announced production shutdowns in recent months. Last month, Indus Motor Company (IMC) announced a 10-day plant shutdown, the third time in 2022, on “hurdles in import and clearance of consignments”. The IMC management mentioned that the central bank had introduced a mechanism for obtaining prior approval for the import of completely knocked-down kits and components of passenger cars for the auto sector. “[However,] the delay in aforesaid approvals for the company and its vendors has created hurdles in import and clearance of consignments for raw materials and components of the company,” the IMC said. Auto parts maker Baluchistan Wheels Limited also announced plant closure on depressed demand last week. "

        description: "KARACHI: Surge in the prices of chicken, rice, and wheat flour pushed weekly inflation up 1.09% during the seven-day period that ended January 5 (Thursday). Annualised inflation hiked by 30.60%, increasing the worries of low and middle-income groups, who might soon lose their spending capacity for even essential commodities, the data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Friday showed. The PBS data attributed the WoW increase in sensitive price indicator (SPI) to the rise in the prices of chicken (16.09 %), broken rice basmati (5.16%), wheat flour (4.87%), rice irri-6/9 (3.45%), bananas (2.97%), onions (2.65%), bread (1.24%), salt powdered (1.07%) and pulse moong (1.02%). On the other hand, the decrease was observed in the prices of potatoes (4.61%), eggs (1.31%), tomatoes (1.17%), LPG (0.85%), vegetable ghee 2.5kg (0.71%), cooking oil 5 litre (0.32%), sugar (0.24%), vegetable ghee 1kg (0.11%) and pulse masoor (0.05%). Commenting on the weekly data, Ismail Iqbal Securities analyst, Fahad Rauf, said SPI increased mainly due to an increase in chicken and wheat prices. Chicken price has been increasing due to a shortage of soybean feed, whereas the price of wheat was on the higher side because of the support price disparity between Sindh and Punjab, which also resulted in a shortage of grain at wheat flour mills. “We estimate January 2023 CPI (consumer price index) at 27% vs 24.5% in December 2022. We have assumed a further Rs100/kg increase in chicken prices,” Rauf noted. The price of a 20kg wheat flour bag has been on an upwards trajectory since the week-ended November 24, 2022 when it was Rs1,509.83/bag. In the weeks since then 20kg wheat flour price has jumped up by Rs187.79/20kg bag on average to stand at Rs1,697.62/bag. During the same week last year, the price was Rs1,167.96/20kg bag as per the PBS data. This shows that the average price of a wheat flour bag weighing 20kg has increased by Rs529.66 for consumers. However, on a year-on-year basis, this shows a 45.35% hike in the price of the essential commodity. The PBS data attributes different weightages to the commodities in the SPI basket. For the group with the lowest spending capacity, wheat flour holds a weightage of 6.1372%, whereas for the combined group the weightage stands at 3.9725%. "

        description: "KABUL: Afghanistan Taliban-led administration is to sign a contract with a Chinese company to extract oil from the Amu Darya basin in the countrys north, the acting mining minister said on Thursday. The contract would be signed with Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Co (CAPEIC), officials told a news conference in Kabul. It will be the first major public commodities extraction deal the Taliban administration has signed with a foreign company since taking power in 2021. It also underscores neighbouring Chinas economic involvement in the region even though the Islamic State militant group has targeted its citizens in Afghanistan. The Amu Darya oil contract is an important project between China and Afghanistan, Chinas ambassador, Wang Yu, told the news conference. China has not formally recognised the Taliban administration but it has significant interests in a country at the centre of a region important for its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. The Chinese company will invest $150 million a year in Afghanistan under the contract, the spokesperson for the Taliban-run administration, Zabihullah Mujahid, said on Twitter. Its investment would increase to $540 million in three years for the 25-year contract, he said. The Taliban-run administration will have a 20% partnership in the project, which can be increased to 75%, he added. The announcement came a day after the Taliban administration said its forces had killed eight Islamic State members in raids, including some who were behind an attack last month on a hotel catering to Chinese businessmen in the capital, Kabul. China state-owned company National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) signed a contract with Afghanistan previous, US-backed government in 2012 to extract oil at the Amu Darya basin in the northern provinces of Faryab and Sar-e Pul. At the time, up to 87 million barrels of crude were estimated to be in Amu Darya. Acting Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Baradar told the news conference that another Chinese company, which he did not identify, had not continued extraction after the fall of the previous government so the deal had been struck with CAPEIC. We ask the company to continue the procedure according to international standards, also we ask them to provide for the interest of the people of Sar-e Pul, he said."

        description: "GENEVA: Flexible working arrangements like those introduced during the COVID-19 crisis are not only good for employees but also boost productivity and potentially a businesss bottom line, the United Nations said Friday. In its first report focusing on work-life balances, the UNs International Labour Organisation evaluated the effects of working time, working hours and working time arrangements on the well-being of staff and also on business performance. This report shows that if we apply some of the lessons of the COVID-19 crisis and look very carefully at the way working hours are structured, as well as their overall length, we can create a win-win, improving both business performance and work-life balance, Jon Messenger, lead author of the report, said in a statement. The report examines the crisis response measures governments and businesses used as the pandemic spread, aimed at keeping organisations functioning and workers employed. It found that the larger proportion of workers on reduced hours helped to prevent job losses. And it determined that the large-scale implementation of telework put in place around the world had changed not only teleworking but also the nature of employment, most likely for the foreseeable future. The COVID measures provided powerful evidence, the ILO said, that giving workers more flexibility in how, where and when they work could be positive not only for them but also for businesses, including through increased productivity. On the flip side, restricting flexibility increased costs, including because of increased staff turnover, the report found. There is a substantial amount of evidence that work-life balance policies provide significant benefits to enterprises, The ILO emphasised that teleworking and other flexible working arrangements helped maintain employment while encouraging more employee autonomy. But it said regulation, including so-called right to disconnect policies, was needed to avert negative effects. According to the report, far from everyone in the global workforce works a standard eight-hour day, or 40 hours a week. More than a third regularly work more than 48 hours each week, while 20% work fewer than 35 hours per week."

        id: 5, name: "Global economy 2023: Why there will still be plenty of pressure on food prices in the year ahead", image: "./images/business5.jpg",
        description: "Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in March, the closely watched food price index of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) reached its highest recorded level, stoking consumer prices across the world. In the UK, for example, the prices of many everyday items increased way ahead of inflation, with bread and eggs both up 18% in the year to December, and milk up 30%. Such rises threatened food security, particularly in low and middle-income countries that rely heavily on Ukraine and Russia for grains and plant oils. That included many countries in Africa and Asia, which took 95% of Ukraines wheat exports in 2021 (roughly a tenth of the world supply). This prompted much talk in the media about the potential for famine. Yet nearly a year after the invasion, the FAO food price index has returned to pre-invasion levels. So why has the pressure on prices been reduced, and what are the prospects for the year ahead? You cant look at food in isolation from COVID. Many people in the energy and food industries were either too ill to work or prevented from doing so because of pandemic restrictions, which squeezed supplies. When the world opened up and demand began to rise, food and energy prices went up too. This made people particularly vulnerable to events in Ukraine. Once the war began, food-price inflation peaked because the markets were uncertain about whether production and exports would be hit, and how global supply chains would adapt. Ukraine grain exports resumed after a UN deal was brokered in July to create a humanitarian corridor through the Black Sea. It also helped that the wheat harvest was larger than expected, even if large areas around the front line remain unharvested.  Much of Ukraine’s corn has not been harvested either, for the additional reason that the drying process is energy intensive and farmers struggled to afford the raised prices. Overall, Ukraine’s grain exports were down in 2022 by about 30% year on year. Russia is normally an even bigger exporter of wheat than Ukraine, supplying about 15% of world demand. Its harder to see what has happened to these supplies because the Russians stopped providing data, but certainly, Moscows policy of only dealing with “friendly” countries will have affected availability for many countries too.

        description: "Gold recovered after dipping below the key Rs188,000 level a day earlier and registering its worst fall in the last few months as bleak economic data underscored concerns over an economic slowdown. On Thursday, gold crashed as much as Rs5,200 per tola, however, it resumed its uptrend on Friday. Data released by All-Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA) showed that the price of gold rose by Rs300 per tola and Rs257 per 10 grams to settle at Rs183,700 and Rs157,493. The association mentioned that a majority of the buyers in the local market comprise gold investors these days. Earlier, they were parking their savings in the US dollar to avoid the impact of rupee devaluation at a time of high inflation. They mentioned that the investors started moving to the bullion market following the shortfall of the dollar in the open market. In the black market, illegal traders were selling the dollar for Rs250-260 compared to Rs227 in the interbank market. Analysts believe the decline registered a day earlier was a healthy correction, it allows more people to get in, so prices started rallying again. Meanwhile, goldsmiths anticipate that the price of gold may rise to Rs200,000 per tola due to the rupee devaluation against the US dollar under the current cycle. However, they also believe that an inflow of $6-8 billion from multilateral and bilateral creditors will burst the pricing bubble in Pakistan. In the international market, the gold price settled at $1,839 after a decline of $9 per ounce. Meanwhile, silver rates decreased by Rs30 per tola to reach Rs2,100 in the country. The price of 10-gram silver also declined by Rs25.72 to Rs1,800.41."

The local unit closed at 227.14 against the greenback after a meagre decline of 0.01% in the interbank market compared to Thursdays close of 227.12, data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed. The currency traded in the range of 226-227 during the week as the movement of the local currency was caused by a demand for dollars from importers in the foreign exchange market. During the week ended on December 30, 2022, the central banks forex reserves fell $245 million to $5.57 billion, down from last week reserves of $5.821 billion. Additionally, the rupee is expected to stay under pressure in the coming days due to the International Monetary Funds (IMF) demand for the maintenance of a market-based currency rate. Financial pundits said that the recent stability in the official exchange rate is not sustainable. The longer the government continues to pursue its plan to support the currency artificially, the more distortion it may produce. By June 2023, analysts expect the rupee value will reach at least 250. Political instability and a precarious external account position will keep pressure on the rupee and things may grow significantly worse if the IMF programme is delayed any longer. "

        description: "LAHORE: Commercial banks are refusing to issue letters of credit (LCs) for edible oil imports despite the exclusion of the sector from the condition of prior permission from the central bank, The News reported Friday.  Edible oil importers and ghee manufacturers have been informed unofficially that their letters of credit cannot be opened at the interbank exchange rates. However, the commercial banks were very much willing to do business with these importers if they were willing to open credit letters at Rs250 and above the exchange rate against a dollar. Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers Association (PVMA) Chairman Sheikh Abdul Razzaq in a letter to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor said that “the Commercial Banks are conveying to the importers-cum-manufacturers of edible oil that with immediate effect the edible oil has been excluded from the list of Essential Items and hence turning down the requests for opening of L/Cs/retirement of documents”. He further mentioned that the un-hindered opening of letters of credit/retirement of documents was inevitable. It should be given priority as accorded by SBP earlier vide EPD circular letter no. 20 of 2022 dated December 27, 2022, to avoid any crisis in the country, which could lead to an increase in prices of cooking oil/ghee and shortage due to the non-availability of the raw material (edible oil). Pakistan imports 90% of its edible oil demand to meet the national requirement of over 4.5 million metric tonnes per annum. The existing domestic stocks are sufficient to meet the demand for only three to four weeks. However, the interruption in opening letters of credit could disrupt the smooth supply line and result in market disruption. PVMA chairman requested the SBP to address the issue immediately and set aside the likely panic in the market, which might translate into a price hike, hoarding or retarded imports resulting in shortages. “The industry is experiencing a unique and unprecedented kind of challenge wherein despite of sufficient stocks discharged in custom bonded warehouses at Karachi, it is unable to lift them due to refusal by banks to retire the documents,” he said. Razzaq urged the SBP to direct the commercial banks to honour the edible oil importers requests for credit letters and further inform the general public through media campaigns."

The Pakistan Stock Exchanges (PSX) benchmark KSE 100-share Index gained 177.44 points or 0.44% to close at 40,716.76 points. Minister for Finance and Revenue Senator Ishaq Dar said Wednesday he sees Saudi Arabia beefing up its deposits in Pakistan within a matter of days, not weeks. The statement comes as a default risk looms over Pakistan, the rupee continues to depreciate against the US dollar, and forex reserves have plunged to record lows — covering merely a months imports. Financial pundits, voicing concerns since the ouster of the previous government, say the country financial side will remain vulnerable until there is political stability. Topline Securities said equities had a positive day with low volumes. “The cautious market behaviour can be attributed to the expectation regarding some breakthrough on the circular debt front, confirmation of funds flow from friendly countries and donor conference (scheduled on Jan 9, 2023),” the brokerage said. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)-held foreign exchange reserves fell further as the country paid external debts amid a severe economic crisis. During the week ended on December 30, 2022, the central banks forex reserves fell $245 million to $5.57 billion, a statement from the central bank said Thursday, down from last weeks reserves of $5.821 billion. The net foreign reserves held by commercial banks amount to $5.84 billion, with the total reserves clocking in at $11.42 billion, the statement mentioned. The reserves, which hit their lowest level since April 2014, will now only provide import cover of 1.06 months, as the country tries to lessen imports amid the greenback shortage.

Analysts said the deepening economic crisis has thrown spanners in the works of many industries until recently, bringing their productions to a halt and in some cases causing massive layoffs. The MTL is not the first company that has opted for a shutdown to save it from further losses as a number of others have also fully or partially quit operations because of demand, inventory, energy, and supply chain constraints. The tractor-maker expressed these views in a notice submitted to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). Due to continuing reduced demand for tractors and cash flow constraints, the Company will remain closed from Friday, January 06, 2023 till further notice, Talking to Geo.tv, former advisor to the Ministry of Finance Dr Khaqan Hassan Najeeb said Pakistan economy suffered a number of shocks, including floods, high commodity prices, and inflation. It is the continued dollar liquidity crunch which has forced a need for contraction of the economy and a shutdown of many companies, Without resolving this issue by engaging with multilateral and bilateral [institutions] and a resumption of the IMF programme, Pakistan would find it difficult to come out of present challenges, Last month, the MTL, in a statement sent to the PSX, announced the closure of its production on Fridays citing a decline in demand for tractors in the country. Due to reduced demand for tractors, the company will observe Fridays as non-production days from December 16, 2022, till further notice, As per the analysts, the agricultural land of Sindh was still under water in many areas due to the cataclysmic floods in the country. They added that there was also an increase in inflation in the country which has led to a reduction in demand for tractors. In October, Millat Tractors recorded a decrease of 75% month-on-month and 72% year-on-year to reach a sales figure of 638 units due to the shutdown of plants for 23 days in September amid floods. "

        description: "Coming of age in Pakistan at a time when the country was in the constitutionalised clutches of Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf, and Benazir  Bhutto was in exile, I was always awed by the raw power and uncanny charisma the latter exuded to the masses with unmatchable grace. Being the only woman featured among the male politicians, presidents, and prime ministers of Pakistan, Benazir exerted an extraordinary influence against the prevalent and dominant patriarchal political landscape of the country, while emboldening the concept of what a woman can achieve in politics. Her pictures, as a prime minister, of holding young Bilawal by his hand while carrying baby Bakhtawar and a teddy bear in her arms will forever be ingrained in the minds of Pakistanis who wish to see a vocal, fierce, and blunt female legislator who can advocate and curate rules that are more gender neutral. But Benazir, like Fatima Jinnah and Begum Rana Liaquat Ali, got an already ornate centerstage set by her father. However, what set Benazir apart was her struggle against the misogynist dictatorship of that time. Sharing the presidentship of Pakistan’s biggest political party of the time with her mother, the mother-daughter duo, with backing from the core leadership of the PPP fought and advocated for their causes and eventually made Pakistan the first Muslim country to ever have a female prime minister. PPP with its quasi-socialist and part-progressive policies during the time positioned itself as the champion of equal rights for the political participation of women. Electing the first-ever female minister was supposed to pave way for more women to enter the political and legislative arena of the country but four decades later, instead of moving forward, Pakistan seems to have taken five steps backwards. While Benazir party has somewhat upheld the principle of gender neutrality in providing important policy-making and ministerial positions to its female members, other parties seem to be far behind in this pursuit. Women, despite their higher population as compared to men, are still far behind in many social aspects of the country. But while those social aspects are challenged time and time again by rare prodigies, novel instances of Nobel peace prize and Oscar award winners, the ground reality especially in politics and other departments directly associated with and impacting women is continuously depressing.

        description: "Karachi is not just a city of life. It is a city of colours, light, and hope too. The warmth it offers to its people is unmatched and there is no way one cant find a reason to stay here. Long before the air-conditioned malls and brands, the bazaars in Karachi were the real deal. Meena Bazaar, situated in Karimabad, is one of the oldest such bazaars in the city. The name is inspired by the special Mughal Era events, organised during the festival of Navroz —the Persian new year which fell on the first day of the Spring Equinox, usually March 21. Navroz comes in the Persian month of Favardin. Under the Mughals, this festival was celebrated for 19 days with the first and last day being considered auspicious. Those Meena Bazaars were set up by women for women and no men were allowed to attend them except for the rulers of the time. The heritage continues to date for which space is set up where everything from traditional bangles to delicate jhumkas (ear pendants) and radiant dupattas (long head scarfs) is available. However, what sets apart this market from others in Karachi is a portion solely dedicated to women micro-entrepreneurs. As the world is transforming into a global village, entrepreneurship is a word that is thrown a lot up into the air without its meaning being realised truly. But this bazaar is a living example of how women with almost no privilege can become successful entrepreneurs only driven by their raw dedication. They are micro-entrepreneurs with macro business drives. As you enter the bazaar, taking a few steps ahead will lead to multiple staircases from where you can go to the upper portion which is a no-man-zone since only women are allowed to shop and sell there. The absolute chaos of multiple businesswomen trying to lure you into buying their services by hawking ‘Idhar aajeyen baaji’ will remind you of the hustle and bustle of the city. As you walk around that portion, you will experience the true essence of womens empowerment.With nearly 45 functional shops around the floor, services like henna, personal hygiene, womens sanitary products, and grooming can be availed. Special discounts on bridal services are also offered and no matter what time of the day you go to go there, the market is always full of women getting their henna (tattooing) done or shopping for personal accessories.

        description: "Truck art, a form of colourful folk fine art, extremely popular with South Asian transporters, is traditionally referred to as phool patti (flower and petal) in Pakistan, and extravagantly embellished goods-moving trucks, crisscrossing the country, are its celebrated masterpieces that awe the onlookers. Many refer to these vehicles as jingle trucks because of the jingly exterior decorations that hang from their bumpers. While truck art is found throughout Pakistan with regional variations, Karachi serves as its primary hub. Pakistan’s roadways are home to more than 277,000 trucks. Their extravagantly designed and colourful displays incorporate intricate striping, fish, peacocks, flowers, politicians, actors, cricket players, and singers. Into the bargain, they feature wooden frames, metalwork that sparkles in the sunlight, and bells and pom-poms dangling from their sides and front and back fenders. Truck drivers and artists in the region see them as more than just a means of freight transportation. Apart from being the pride and joy of their owners, these ornate trucks are also a platform for spreading strong messages and promoting the culture of their country. Every truck driver has a unique background or story, and they choose the subject matter for their truck art based on different things: their life experiences, literary favourites, poetic verses, political personates, martyred figures, or sources of inspiration, etc, tells Ali Salman Anchan, founder and creative director of the social enterprise Phool Patti i.e. dedicated to the worldwide promotion of Pakistans truck art. Truckers typically spend more money on their vehicle than they do on their personal needs because they want their truck to stand out and be the finest. While the bright colours and lavish decorations are indeed lovely, they do it for personal satisfaction rather than commercial gain. “Now, the price varies depending on the configuration of the vehicle — a bus, a cargo truck, a water tanker, a loading truck, etc. If I only talk about the painting of a single truck, it may cost anywhere between Rs5,000 and Rs300,000 or even more,” says Anchan. Additionally, there is internal and external design, including ornaments, taj, steel, and wood, among other things, which completes the look, and raises the price according to the level of intricacy.

This is among the 1,2325 of the 2,000 or so health facilities, in all of Sindhs 29 districts, run by the Peoples Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI-Sindh), a non-profit under a public-private partnership model started some 16 years ago. Belonging to the village of Behram Chandio, in Dadu, which had submerged under the flood waters, she, along with her husband and five kids, had taken refuge on the embankment of the Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD), along with thousands of others. “We were rescued by the Navy and brought to dryland on a boat after our homes were swamped with floodwaters. “My timing is not good,” said the mother of five, referring to her eleventh pregnancy in a time of crisis and displacement. Floods or no floods, it was an unplanned pregnancy. “We even went to a doctor for termination but were told it was too late to get an abortion,” said her husband Saleh. “The first two kids are alive, the third died, the fourth survived but the following three died,” Safia paused and started recalling and the counting started again. “The eighth survived, the ninth died and the tenth is alive.” The couple knew of some modern contraceptive methods but were yet to use them. Safia wanted to space her births but could not. According to the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) 2017-18, the average birth interval between babies in Pakistan is two-and-a-half years, although 37% of births still occur within 24 months of the last birth. Safia did not look too well. She said she was running a fever, complained of body aches and said there was too much pressure on her abdomen making it difficult to carry out daily chores or even walk too long. With delivery time nearing, she was getting anxious. Four of her deliveries had been at a private clinic in the city of Khairpur Nathan Shah, of which two were through Cesarean section. The uncertainty of not knowing when they would go back to their village or whether the clinic was still there was gnawing at her, as was the fact that they had no money to bear the expenses. "

        description: "When the floods were bucketing towards his village in Sindhs Khairpur district, Nazil Solangi, 60, lay in his cot, tormented by the thought of how is he going to find his feet to escape to safety when the runway waters overrun his dwellings like mighty armies of foreign invaders, and rightly so as he was mostly cot-ridden for the last ten years after suffering a stroke. And when the dreaded deluge rolled into his village with all its force, Solangis kind neighbours had to wade through the shifting floodwaters to carry him away to higher ground with much difficulty. Most of the elderly were rushed to safety that way, thanks to selfless rural social bonds. “The local dispensary was damaged and there are no doctors to look after us. When my husband fell sick, my son became the only breadwinner of the family. After the floods, he couldn’t find any work, and most of our livestock was killed. We sold the last one to meet the basic needs of our family. We don’t know what will happen in the future,” said Naheed Solangi, 60, Nazil’s spouse, speaking to the activists of Helpage, a non-profit organisation. The ageing Solangi family is not alone in this ordeal. There is a large number of ailing old flood victims struggling to stay afloat after floods displaced them from their humble dwellings. Villagers usually thought of as being tough as nails have their own vulnerabilities. The topmost is healthcare, which is scarce in the remote parts of rural Sindh. The already immunocompromised elderly are the ones that need the most care as they are natural magnets to water-borne as well as vector-borne (insect-bite-caused) and other infectious maladies in the areas that have been claimed by the floodwaters and turned nearly into cesspools over time. Nazil, who is dependent on medication to stay alive, was forced to live under the open sky for two weeks, which worsened his condition. His house was completely flooded and he lost the roof and all his belongings. Unfortunately, he had no choice but to return to live in the damaged house. He is no longer able to access his blood-thinning medicine and became ill. His son had to take him to the nearest hospital to get treatment and to be able to access his medication. A new survey on the impact of the floods in Pakistan on older people reveals that hundreds of lives are needlessly being put at risk due to the decimation of health services and the rise of diseases like malaria and diarrhoea."
